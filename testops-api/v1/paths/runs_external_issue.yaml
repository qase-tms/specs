  summary: Update external issues for runs
  description: |
    This method allows you to update links between test runs and external issues (such as Jira tickets).

    You can use this endpoint to:
    - Link test runs to external issues by providing the external issue identifier (e.g., "PROJ-1234")
    - Update existing links by providing a new external issue identifier
    - Remove existing links by setting the external_issue field to null

    **Important**: Each test run can have only one link with an external issue. If a test run already has an external issue link, providing a new external_issue value will replace the existing link.

    The endpoint supports both Jira Cloud and Jira Server integrations. Each request can update multiple test run links in a single operation.
